# TF2 Utils

SourceMod utility natives for Team Fortress 2.  Mainly focused around gameplay-related
functionality that require gamedata that may break during updates, including calls to game
functions and raw memory accessors that aren't already in some other library.

One of the design decisions is to only use dependencies built-in to SourceMod.  That means this
excludes most hooks (handled by [DHooks][]), and `SDKCall`s that require allocation of some
structure (which can be done with [Source Scramble][]).
